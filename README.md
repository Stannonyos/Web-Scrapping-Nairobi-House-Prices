# Web-Scrapping-Nairobi-House-Prices

Web Scraping is a technique of getting data from website. Using R packages such as rvest, you can mine data from HTML, XML and JSON sources.
The data can be put in a dataframe and then analyzed.

I have used rvest to mine data on rental houses in Nairobi i.e. address, number of rooms and price. With the data, it will be now simple to analyze.
